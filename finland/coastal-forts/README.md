Here you can find Lua script to include Finnish coastal forts to your scenarios.

Scripts starting with `simple-` uses a much simpler way of adding these forts to
Command: Modern Operations (CMO) scenarios. Each fort is added as a one facility
instead of each gun in the battery being a separate bunker somewhere in the island.
This is done because CMO doesn't model Finnish archipelago correctly.

I have added comments to each scripts to include additional information that may
be helpful for you.
